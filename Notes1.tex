C++11 (formerly known as C++0x) is a version of the standard of the C++ programming language. It was approved by ISO on 12 August 2011, replacing C++03,[1] and superseded by C++14 on 18 August 2014.[2] The name follows the tradition of naming language versions by the year of the specification's publication.
 
C++11 includes several additions to the core language and extends the C++ standard library, incorporating most of the C++ Technical Report 1 (TR1) libraries â€” with the exception of the library of mathematical special functions.[3] C++11 was published as ISO/IEC 14882:2011[4] in September 2011 and is available for a fee. The working draft most similar to the published C++11 standard is N3337, dated 16 January 2012;[5] it has only editorial corrections from the C++11 standard.[6]
 
Work is currently under way on the C++17 standards.[7]
